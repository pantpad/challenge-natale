# Challenge Natalizia

## Objective:

Create a mockup entirely at your discretion, where the key element is to include a list of available planets, displaying only the title of the planet and its corresponding image.
Upon clicking a planet, the details of that specific planet (description, gravity, distance, etc.) should appear on the screen wherever you choose.
